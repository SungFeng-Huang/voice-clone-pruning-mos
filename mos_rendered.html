  <h1>Intructions</h1>

  <p>There are 4 sections below, each section corresponds to a target speaker.</p>

  <p>Each section has 9 testing audio clips (real or generated speech) with 3 questions each (speaker similarity and naturalness) to rate. </p>


  <h3>Speaker Similarity</h3>
  <p>There are 2 reference recordings of the target speaker and 1 testing audio sample in each question:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Please listen carefully to each sample. You must listen to both the reference and the test recordings before selecting your answer. </li>
    <li> Judge how similar is the testing audio's voice comparing to the target speaker. </li>
    <li> If the recording sounds <b>very differently with different biological sex</b>, select <b>"Bad - Completely different voice"</b>. </li>
    <li> If the recording sounds <b>very differently while with the same biological sex</b>, select <b>"Poor - Mostly dissimilar voice"</b>. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio sample can be <b>heavily-accented</b> and <b> difficult to understand</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely the same voice"</b>. Please use your best judgements. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Accent Similarity</h3>

  <ul>
    <li> Please listen carefully to each sample. You must listen to both the reference and the test recordings before selecting your answer. </li>
    <li> Judge how similar is the testing audio's accent comparing to the target speaker. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio sample can <b>sound like different speaker</b> and be <b> difficult to understand</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely the same accent"</b>. Please use your best judgements. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Naturalness</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> You must listen to the entire audio clip before rating. </li>
    <li> You may play each clip a maximum of three times. </li>
    <li> You should take <b>fluency</b>, audio <b>quality</b>, and <b>style consistency across sentences</b> into account. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio clip can be <b>heavily-accented</b> and <b> difficult to understand</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely natural speech"</b>. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio clip can be <b>not intelligible and contains missing words</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely natural speech"</b>. Please use your best jedgements. </li>
    <li> For instance, the reference recordings used in speaker similarity questions should be considered <b>"Excellent - Completely natural speech"</b>, even though they might have a heavy accent.
