  <h1>Intructions</h1>
  <p><b style="color:#FF0000">Please read the instructions carefully before answering the questions.</b></p>

  <p>There are <b>2 sections</b> below, each section with <b>9 testing audio
  clips and 2 reference recordings</b>
  correspond to a target speaker.<br>
  That is, there would be 9+2 audio clips in each of the 2 sections, where
  <b style="color:#FF0000">the total duration of the recordings in this HIT
  would be in 0.5 to 1.5 minutes</b>.</p>

  <p>For each testing audio clip (real or generated speech), there are <b>3
  questions</b> (speaker similarity, accent similarity and naturalness) to
  rate.<br>
  Limited to the MTurk UI, each question occupy the page and would make the
  comparison difficult if the reference recordings only appear once in the
  beginning of the section.<br>
  Therefore, for easier comparison, we would <b>repeatedly put the test and reference recordings in
  each question</b>.<br>
  If you've listened to the reference recordings in the beginning of each
  section, or listened to the test recording before its 3 questions,
  <i style="color:#FF0000">it is not required to listen to them again in each
  question.</i>
  It's opt to you to listen to each recording only once at the beginning or
  multiple times for better judgements.</p>

  <p>Limited to the MTurk UI, each question occupy the page and making the HIT
  seemed to be very long.<br>
  However, bare in mind that you should rate <b>according to your 1st impression</b> and
  don't take too much time thinking.
  So it won't take too much time to finish it.<br>
  <b>The total duration of the audio clips is in <font color="red">0.5 to 1.5
  minutes</font>, and the rest of
  the time is for you to make your best judgements.</b></p>

  <hr style="width:50%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
  <p style="color:#FF0000">The following answering instructions would also be placed in
  each question as a reminder. It is not required to read them again in each question.</p>

  <h3>Speaker Similarity</h3>
  <p>There are 2 reference recordings of the target speaker and 1 testing audio sample in each question:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Please listen carefully to each sample. You must listen to both the reference and the test recordings before selecting your answer. </li>
    <li> Judge how similar is the testing audio's voice comparing to the target speaker. </li>
    <li> If the recording sounds <b>very differently with different biological sex</b>, select <b>"Bad - Completely different voice"</b>. </li>
    <li> If the recording sounds <b>very differently while with the same biological sex</b>, select <b>"Poor - Mostly dissimilar voice"</b>. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio sample can be <b>heavily-accented</b> and <b> difficult to understand</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely the same voice"</b>. Please use your best judgements. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Accent Similarity</h3>
  <p>There are 2 reference recordings of the target speaker and 1 testing audio sample in each question:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Please listen carefully to each sample. You must listen to both the reference and the test recordings before selecting your answer. </li>
    <li> Judge how similar is the testing audio's accent comparing to the target speaker. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio sample can <b>sound like different speaker</b> and be <b> difficult to understand</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely the same accent"</b>. Please use your best judgements. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Naturalness</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> You must listen to the entire audio clip before rating. </li>
    <li> You may play each clip a maximum of three times. </li>
    <li> You should take <b>fluency</b>, audio <b>quality</b>, and <b>style consistency across sentences</b> into account. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio clip can be <b>heavily-accented</b> and <b> difficult to understand</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely natural speech"</b>. </li>
    <li> Note that, an audio clip can be <b>not intelligible and contains missing words</b> while being <b>"Excellent - Completely natural speech"</b>. Please use your best jedgements. </li>
    <li> For instance, the reference recordings should be considered <b>"Excellent - Completely natural speech"</b>, even though they might have a heavy accent.
